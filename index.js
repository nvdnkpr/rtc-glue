  # rtc-glue

  Glue is a high-level approach to building WebRTC applications. It is
  primarily designed for web application coders who would prefer to spend
  their time in HTML and CSS rather than JS.

  ## Example Usage

  Glue works by looking for HTML tags that follow particular conventions
  with regards to named attributed, etc.  For instance, consider the
  following HTML:

  <<< examples/simple.html

**/
module.exports = function() {

};
